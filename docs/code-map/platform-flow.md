# Platform Flow

本文描述 QRP 当前代码流程。QRP 是 local research platform，只覆盖本地研究、验证和 REVIEW_SAFE evidence；边界是 no trading execution 和 no production trading boundary。

## 总体链路

```text
sources -> markets implementation -> storage -> research -> reports -> artifacts
```

研究链路：

```text
dataset -> factor -> feature -> label -> model -> prediction -> signal -> evaluation -> portfolio -> result -> evidence/report payload -> files
```

长期合同锚点：

```text
data -> feature -> signal/model -> evaluate -> evidence
```

该链路受 current contract 和 current-contract-only 约束：文档、脚本、tests 和 handoff evidence 只保护当前合同。

## Layer Contracts

`policy/` owns share safety, identifier safety, and check status aggregation. `contracts/` owns structure only. `catalog/` owns generic registry classes. `profiles/` is the composition root used by API, CLI, agents, and workflows.

`research/` builds results only and does not write files. `reports/` builds and renders evidence/report content only. `artifacts/` writes LOCAL_ONLY run outputs and REVIEW_SAFE evidence files. `workflows/` only orchestrates research -> reports -> artifacts. `storage/` only owns dataset IO and data layout.

## Interfaces

Current public API:

```text
GET  /api/0.1/catalog/factors
GET  /api/0.1/catalog/labels
GET  /api/0.1/research-datasets/{dataset_id}/requirements
```

Current public CLI:

```text
qrp catalog factors
qrp catalog labels
qrp research-datasets requirements <dataset_id>
```

`.agents tooling` only carries governance, handoff, and prompt tooling. `.run output/evidence` is an output layer, not an architecture or tool source.

`private data safety` remains a hard boundary: REVIEW_SAFE evidence must use summaries, counts, hashes, schemas, command status, and sanitized text only.
